TITLE: Project Assignment, Step 8.


Prepare by: Michel Ngako


I – Introduction (The author)


I am Michel Ngako, active duty army working as soldier and then manager for three years and a half.  I am attending MSSA (Microsoft Software & Systems Academy) as a medium to transitioning out to a new career in Information technology (cloud developer). 

II- Short summary of the project

Our project consists on a conception, design, implementation and delivering of an application name “SHADOWS”.

The software will be use as a platform to connect mentors (experts, professionals) with mentees (students, working persons looking for a new career or anyone who need guidance). The high-level requirement of the software will be:

-	A great but simple interface, so people can easily navigate our platform. 
-	A database, where will be store and retrieve data's that users will input and will be using to match the right mentor to the right mentee.
-	 Using azure cloud technology, asp.net MVC5.

III-Information architecture of the project.

For information architecture, We will focused on data collected, frame or visual organization structure and content organizational model.

Data's collected will be mostly mentors information such as: identification, location, service provide etc.). mentee information when they sign up to request some services and all the interaction between them.

For the framework or visual, we will have: our logo plus name of application, mentor/mentee sign up button, sign in tab, products/services button, social media logos, large space with meaningful image in background illustrating our application purpose. About, home, contacts tabs. 
Two levels for mobile three for web.

Organization of the structure will be based on hierarchical  content structure for his simplicity and clarity of view.


IV-Design and implementation of the database

Our database is being design using Microsoft SQL server management studio. It contents O7 tables as we describe in step 07 of this project(Mentor, mentee, skills etc.).
