TITLE: Project Assignment, Step 3.


Prepare by: Michel Ngako


I – Introduction (The author)


I am Michel Ngako, active duty army working as soldier and then manager for three years and a half.  I am attending MSSA (Microsoft Software & Systems Academy) as a medium to transitioning out to a new career in Information technology (cloud developer. 

In eighteen weeks, we will learn programing through C# Language, T-SQL, AZURE, Java script, CSS, GIT, project management and many more. It is truly a complete program that will equip me with necessary tools to succeed in my dream career.

One of the requirement to successfully complete the training is to successfully follow through a personal project deliver in a weekly basis. I have chosen to create an application name “SHADOWS”. 



 II- Purpose of the software 
  
The software will be use as a platform to connect mentors (experts, professionals) with mentees (students, working persons looking for a new career or anyone who need guidance). The high-level requirement of the software will be:
-	A great but simple interface, so people can easily navigate our platform. 
-	A database, where will be store and retrieve datas that users will input and will be using to match the right mentor to the right mentee.
-	 Using azure cloud technology.


III- Resources


Our resources for this project will include the following: MSDN website for C# code reference, T-SQL language and SQL server and management studio for the database, google or Bing for searches, ASP.NET, html5, CSS for interface design. Small Business Administration (SBA) about their public program in accompany business procedure.
We will be referring to a couple of software close to the "SHADOWS" such as Mentorcity.com and Findamentor.com.

IV. Conclusion

To summarize, “SHADOWS” will be a matching platform that will help mentors and mentees to reach their goals; ones(mentors) developing and scaling their knowledge and in the long run make money, others(mentees) will have guidance and lead they will need.
